# 3-point_lensing
##Research Objectives:
- Used multipole expansion and built a mathematical model to describe dark matter halo shapes.  
- Developed new statistical tool (3-point cross correlation) to extract signal from noisy lensing measurement.

##Achievement:
- A 10-fold improvement in the measurement accuracy of dark matter halo shapes when tested with simulation data.  
- Designed parallelized C codes by OpenMP to speed up scientific computation by ~16 times in Illinois campus cluster golub.  
- Wrote Class in Python to structuralize member variables and functions for cosmological calculation, for example defining different cosmological parameters, cosmological distances measurement, etc.  
- Implemented "Triangular-Shaped-Cloud" algorithm in C to reduce shot noise of simulated data during particle projection.  
- Performed Fast Fourier Transform to convert surface mass density to shear profiles via SciPy fftpack package (data transformation).

##Statistical, mathematical and simulation tools:  
- Multipole expansion  
- 3-point cross-correlation functions  
- Numerical integral, e.g. Romberg integral
- Fast Fourier Transform  
- "Triangular-Shaped-Cloud" algorithm

##Computer science skills:  
- Object-oriented-programming in Python (Class)
- Struct in C
- Parallelized code in C using OpenMP (cut down a factor of ~16 runtime)
