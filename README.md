# 3-point_lensing
- Developed a new 3-point cross-correlation technique, which achieved a 10-fold improvement in the measurement accuracy of dark matter halo shapes by a factor of 10 when tested with simulation data.  
- Designed parallelized C codes by OpenMP to speed up scientific computation by ~16 times in Illinois campus cluster golub.  
- Wrote Class in Python to structuralize member variables and functions for cosmological calculation, for example defining different cosmological parameters, cosmological distances measurement, etc.  
- Implemented "Triangular-Shaped-Cloud" algorithm in C to reduce shot noise of simulated data during particle projection.  
- Performed Fast Fourier Transform to convert surface mass density to shear profiles via SciPy fftpack package (data transformation).
